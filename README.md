# Local Debian Image

This is a remastered Debian ISO image used to provide a default installation
base.

## Building This ISO

This ISO file is pulled directly from the debian release mirror, and will pull
the latest `netinst` image.  This file is about 300MB, and will be downloaded
each build if it doesn't exist.

To build, run `ant` as root:

```bash
sudo ant
```

Root permissions are needed as many of the files that are extracted from the ISO
have root ownership.  Otherwise, the cleanup commands would not work.

## Upstream Reference

The procedure used here (along with the preseed file) is based on the examples
in the Debian wiki:

* https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed
* https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso

## Assumptions Made

This image is built with a couple of assumptions:

1) The installation is completely automated, and will overwrite the first hard
   drive the system sees (`/dev/sda`).
2) The image is not designed to be written to actual media like a CD or USB
   drive.  It's sole purpose is to boot virtual machines.  _In Theory_ it can be
   written to a plain CD, but this has never been tested.
